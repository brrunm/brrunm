## about me 🦇

I'm bruno, a developer with **7+ years of experience** building high-traffic web applications and scalable interfaces.

I work as a frontend-leaning full-stack developer, with strong experience in **React and Next.js**, and solid backend foundations to deliver end-to-end products.

I've led **international projects**, acting as the main technical point of contact and delivering multilingual websites for global audiences. I enjoy working closely with product, design, and business teams to turn complex requirements into simple, effective user experiences.
